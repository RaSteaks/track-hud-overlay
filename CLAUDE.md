# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

HUD5 Overlay — a React + Vite tool that renders a Forza-Horizon-style racing HUD (speedometer, minimap, position, progress) synced to a video and telemetry stream, and exports it as a transparent video for video editors.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev         # Vite dev server on :5173 (includes /api/enrich-gpx middleware)
npm run build       # tsc -b && vite build
npm run preview     # Serve build on :4173 (required before running export)
npm run export      # scripts/export-frames.mjs — Puppeteer + FFmpeg transparent export
npm run enrich:gpx  # scripts/enrich-gpx-with-osm.mjs — OSM road-network enrichment
```

Tests use Node's built-in runner (no test script in package.json). Run individually:

```bash
node --test scripts/enrich-gpx-with-osm.test.mjs
node --test --experimental-strip-types scripts/gpx-enrichment.test.ts
node --test --experimental-strip-types scripts/heading-smoothing.test.ts
```

## Architecture

### Fixed 1920×1080 HUD stage
All HUD components render onto a fixed `1920 x 1080` stage that is scaled to fit the container (`stageScale` in the playback store). Draggable layout offsets are in stage pixels, not screen pixels. The layout is persisted in `localStorage` under key `hud5.layout.v4`; bumping widget shape means bumping the version key.

### Time source switching
Playback has two mutually exclusive time sources, toggled in [src/App.tsx](src/App.tsx):
- **With video**: the `<video>` element is authoritative; `currentTime` is driven from `timeupdate` / `rAF` polling of the element.
- **Without video**: a `requestAnimationFrame` loop in [src/playback/store.ts](src/playback/store.ts) advances `currentTime` against `rate`.

Telemetry samples are indexed by `t` (seconds) and looked up by interpolation at `currentTime`. Track coordinates are projected to a local planar frame in [src/util/projection.ts](src/util/projection.ts) once at load time; the minimap uses those projected points plus a smoothed heading from [src/util/heading.ts](src/util/heading.ts).

### Data ingestion ([src/data/](src/data/))
- `telemetry.ts` — accepts CSV (Papa Parse) or JSON (array, or `{ samples: [...] }`), tolerant of camelCase and snake_case. Required fields: `t` and `speed_kmh`/`speed`. See README for the full field list.
- `track.ts` — accepts GPX (via `@tmcw/togeojson`) or GeoJSON. GeoJSON layers are categorized by `properties.kind` / `properties.type` into `driven` | `planned` | `reference`. GPX `route` → `planned`, GPX `track` → `driven`.
- `gpxEnrichment.ts` / `scripts/enrich-gpx-with-osm.mjs` — shared enrichment logic. The mjs module is imported both by the CLI script and by the Vite dev middleware in [vite.config.ts](vite.config.ts) at `POST /api/enrich-gpx`, which writes results to `output/` and returns them to the browser for immediate minimap use.

### State ([src/playback/store.ts](src/playback/store.ts))
Single Zustand store owns telemetry, track, profile, `currentTime`, playback flags, unit (kmh/mph), exporter mode, edit mode, layout, stage scale, video metadata, and project export settings (`projectFps`, `projectDuration`, `previewAspect`). Components read slices from this store — avoid prop-drilling state.

### Export pipeline
[scripts/export-frames.mjs](scripts/export-frames.mjs) launches Puppeteer against `npm run preview`, loads the app with URL params (see README), and captures frames. FFmpeg then muxes:
- `.webm` → VP9 alpha
- `.mov` / `.mp4` → ProRes 4444 alpha
- other extensions → leave PNG sequence in `out/frames`

FFmpeg must be on `PATH`. The app's `exporter=1` URL param hides the toolbar/timeline so only the HUD renders.

### URL-param loading
The app reads `telemetry`, `track`, `player`, `unit`, `t`, `exporter` from `location.search` on mount. This is the interface the exporter uses, and it's useful for reproducing bugs — prefer a URL over manual drag-and-drop when reproducing.

## Conventions specific to this repo

- HUD stage is fixed at 1920×1080 — don't introduce responsive breakpoints inside `hud/`; scale happens at the stage container.
- The minimap's driven-progress bar is truncated at the interpolated current position to avoid the arrow leading the yellow bar. Preserve that behavior when touching [src/hud/Minimap.tsx](src/hud/Minimap.tsx).
- Dev-server side effects (writing to `output/`) live in the Vite `configureServer` hook, not in browser code — keep filesystem work out of `src/`.
